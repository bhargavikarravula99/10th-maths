# Rational Expressions

Definition : An expression is called a rational expression if it can be written in the form \\(\frac{p(x)}{q(X)}\\) where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials and \\(q(x)\neq 0 \\). A rational expression is the ratio of two polynomials

The following are examples of rational expressions.

\\( \frac{9}{x} , \frac{2y+1}{y^2-4y+9}, \frac{z^3+5}{z-4}, \frac{a}{a+10} \\)

The rational expressions are applied for describing distance-time, modeling multi-task problems, to combine workers or machines to complete a job schedule and much more.

## Reduction of Rational Expression

Reduction of Rational Expression
A rational expression \\(\frac{p(x)}{q(X)}\\)  is said to be in its lowest form if GCD (p(x),q(x)) = 1 .
To reduce a rational expression to its lowest form, follow the given steps
(i) Factorize the numerator and the denominator 
(ii) If there are common factors in the numerator and denominator, cancel them.
(iii) The resulting expression will be a rational expression in its lowest form.

**Example 3.13** Reduce the rational expressions to its lowest form

1. \\(\frac{x-3}{x^2-9}\\) 

2. \\(\frac{x^2-16}{x^2+8x+16}\\)

**Solution** 
1. \\(\frac{x-3}{x^2-9}\\) =\\(\frac{x-3}{(x+3)(x-3)}\\) =\\(\frac{1}{x+3}\\) 

2. \\(\frac{x^2-16}{x^2+8x+16}\\) =\\(\frac{(x+4)(x-4)}{(x+4)^2}\\) \\(\frac{(x-4)}{(x+4)}\\) 

## Excluded Value

A value that makes a rational expression \\(\frac{p(x)}{q(X)}\\) (in its lowest form) undefined is called an Excluded value.

To find excluded value for a given rational expression in its lowest form, say \\(\frac{p(x)}{q(X)}\\) consider the denominator q(x) = 0.
For example, the rational expression \\(\frac{5}{x-10}\\)  is undefined when x = 10 . So, 10  is called an excluded value for \\( \frac{5}{x-10}\\) .

**Example 3.14** Find the excluded values of the following expressions (if any).

(i) \\(\frac{x+10}{8x}\\)  

(ii) \\(\frac{7p+2}{8p^2+13p+5}\\)

(iii) \\(\frac{x}{x^2+1}\\)   

**Solution**
(i) \\(\frac{x+10}{8x}\\)  
The expression \\(\frac{x+10}{8x}\\) is undefined when 8x=0 or x = 0 . Hence the excluded value is 0.

(ii) \\(\frac{7p+2}{8p^2+13p+5}\\)
The expression \\(\frac{7p+2}{8p^2+13p+5}\\) is undefined when \\(8p^2+13p+5=0\\) that is, (8p+5)(p+1)=0.
\\( p= \frac{-5}{8}\\),p=-1.The excluded values are \\(\frac{-5}{8}\\)and -1 .

(iii) \\(\frac{x}{x^2+1}\\)  
Here \\( x^2 \ge 0 \\) for all x. Therefore, \\( x^2+1 \ge 0+1=1 \\). . Hence,\\( x^2+1 ≠ 0\\) for any x.
Therefore, there can be no real excluded values for the given rational expression \\(\frac{x}{x^2+1}\\)

**Exercise 3.4**
1. Reduce each of the following rational expressions to its lowest form.

(i) \\(\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+x}\\) 
(ii) \\(\frac{x^2-11x+18}{x^2-4x+4}\\) 
(iii) \\(\frac{9x^2+81x}{x^3+8x^2-9x}\\) 
(iv) \\(\frac{p^2-3p-40}{2p^3-24p^2+64p}\\) 

2. Find the excluded values, if any of the following expressions.

(i)\\(\frac{y}{y^2-25}\\) 
(ii)\\(\frac{t}{t^2-5t+6}\\)
(iii)\\(\frac{x^2+6x+8}{x^2+x-2}\\) 
(iv)\\(\frac{x^3-27}{x^3+x^2-6x}\\) 

## Operations of Rational Expressions

We have studied the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of rational numbers in previous classes. Now let us generalize the above for rational expressions.

**Multiplication of Rational Expressions**

If \\(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) and \\(\frac{r(x)}{s(x)}\\)  are two rational expressions where \\( q(x)\neq0, s(x)\neq0 \\) ,
their product is \\(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\)x\\(\frac{r(x)}{s(x)}\\)=\\(\frac{p(x)×r(x)}{q(x)×s(x)}\\)   

In other words, the product of two rational expression is the product of their numerators divided by the product of their denominators and the resulting expression is then reduced to its lowest form.

**Division of Rational Expressions**

If \\(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) and \\(\frac{r(x)}{s(x)}\\)  are two rational expressions where \\( q(x), s(x)\neq0 \\) then,

\\(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\)÷\\(\frac{r(x)}{s(x)}\\)=\\(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\)x\\(\frac{s(x)}{r(x)}\\)=\\(\frac{p(x)×s(x)}{q(x)×r(x)}\\)

Thus division of one rational expression by other is equivalent to the product of first 
and reciprocal of the second expression. If the resulting expression is not in its lowest 
form then reduce to its lowest form.

= \\(\frac{(8x+3)(2x-1)}{(3x+1)(x-1)}\\) × \\(\frac{(3x+1(x-4))}{(8x+3)(x+1)}\\)
