The study of numbers has fascinated humans
since several thousands of years. The discovery of
Lebombo and Ishango bones which existed around
25000 years ago has confirmed the fact that humans
made counting process for meeting various day to
day needs. By making notches in the bones they
carried out counting efficiently. Most consider
that these bones were used as lunar calendar for
knowing the phases of moon thereby understanding
the seasons. Thus the bones were considered to be
the ancient tools for counting. We have come a long
way since this primitive counting method existed.

It is very true that the patterns exhibited by numbers have fascinated almost all
professional mathematiciansâ€™ right from the time of Pythagoras to current time. We will be
discussing significant concepts provided by Euclid and continue our journey of studying
Modular Arithmetic and knowing about Sequences and Finite Series. These ideas are
most fundamental to your progress in mathematics for upcoming classes. It is time for us
to begin our journey to understand the most fascinating part of mathematics, namely, the
study of numbers.
