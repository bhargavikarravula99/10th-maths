# Coefficient of Variation 
Comparison of two data in terms of measures of central tendencies and dispersions in some cases will not be meaningful, because the variables in the data may not have same units of measurement. 

For example consider the two data

|  | Weight | Price |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Mean | 8 kg | ₹ 85 |
| Standard deviation | 1.5 kg | ₹ 21.60 |

Here we cannot compare the standard deviations 1.5kg and ₹21.60. For comparing two or more data for corresponding changes the relative measure of standard deviation, called “Coefficient of variation” is used.

Coefficient of variation of a data is obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the arithmetic mean. It is usually expressed in terms of percentage. This concept is suggested by one of the most prominent Statistician Karl Pearson. 

Thus, coefficient of variation of first data {{< katex >}}(C.V_{1})=\frac{\sigma_{1}}{x_{1}} \times 100{{< /katex >}}%

coefficient of variation of second data {{< katex >}}(C.V_{2})=\frac{\sigma_{2}}{x_{2}} \times 100{{< /katex >}}%

The data with lesser coefficient of variation is more consistent or stable than the other data.

Consider the two data
| A | 500 | 900 | 800 | 900 | 700 | 400 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| B | 300 | 540 | 480 | 540 | 420 | 240 |

|  | Mean | Standard deviation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A | 700 | 191.5 |
| B | 420 | 114.9 |

If we compare the mean and standard deviation of the two data, we think that the two datas are entirely different. But mean and standard deviation of _B_ are 60% of that of _A_. Because of the smaller mean the smaller standard deviation led to the misinterpretation.

To compare the dispersion of two data, coefficient of variation{{< katex >}}=\frac{\sigma}{x}{{< /katex >}}x{{< katex >}}100{{< /katex >}}%

The coefficient of variation of {{< katex >}}A=\frac{191.5}{700} \times 100{{< /katex >}}%{{< katex >}}=27.4{{< /katex >}}%

The coefficient of variation of {{< katex >}}B=\frac{114.9}{420} \times 100{{< /katex >}}%{{< katex >}}=27.4{{< /katex >}}%

Thus the two data have equal coefficient of variation. Since the data have equal coefficient of variation values, we can conclude that one data depends on the other. But the data values of _B_ are exactly 60% of the corresponding data values of _A_. So they are very much related. Thus, we get a confusing situation. 

To get clear picture of the given data, we can find their coefficient of variation. This is why we need coefficient of variation.

**Progress Check**

1\. Coefficient of variation is a relative measure of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 

2\. When the standard deviation is divided by the mean we get \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 

3\. The coefficient of variation depends upon \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 

4\. If the mean and standard deviation of a data are 8 and 2 respectively then the
coefficient of variation is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 

5\. When comparing two data, the data with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ coefficient of variation is inconsistent. 

**Example 8.15** The mean of a data is 25.6 and its coefficient of variation is 18.75. Find the standard deviation. 

**_Solution_** Mean {{< katex >}}\bar{x}=25.6{{< /katex >}}. , Coefficient of variation, C.V. = 18.75 Coefficient of variation, C.V. {{< katex >}}=\frac{\sigma}{x}{{< /katex >}}x{{< katex >}}100{{< /katex >}}%

{{< katex >}}18.75=\frac{\sigma}{25.6}{{< /katex >}}x{{< katex >}}100{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}\Rightarrow \sigma = 4.8{{< /katex >}}

**Example 8.16** The following table gives the values of mean and variance of heights and weights of the 10th standard students of a school.

|  | Height | Weight |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Mean | 155 cm | 46.50 kg |
| Variance | 75.25 {{< katex >}}cm^{2}{{< /katex >}} | 28.09 kg |

Which is more varying than the other?

**_Solution_** For comparing two data, first we have to find their coefficient of variations 

Mean {{< katex >}}\bar{x}_{1}=155 cm{{< /katex >}}, variance {{< katex >}}\sigma_{1}^{2}=72.25 cm^{2}{{< /katex >}}

Therefore standard deviation {{< katex >}}\sigma_{1}=8.5{{< /katex >}}

Coefficient of variation {{< katex >}}(C.V_{1})=\frac{\sigma_{1}}{x_{1}} \times 100{{< /katex >}}%

{{< katex >}}C.V_{1}=\frac{8.5}{155} \times 100{{< /katex >}}%{{< katex >}}=5.48{{< /katex >}}%   (for heights)

Mean {{< katex >}}\bar{x}^{2}=46.50 kg{{< /katex >}}, variance {{< katex >}}\sigma_{2}^{x}=28.09 kg^{2}{{< /katex >}}

Standard deviation {{< katex >}}\sigma_{2}=5.3 kg{{< /katex >}}

Coefficient of variation {{< katex >}}(C.V_{2})=\frac{\sigma_{2}}{x_{2}} \times 100{{< /katex >}}%

{{< katex >}}C.V_{2}=\frac{5.3}{46.50} \times 100{{< /katex >}}%{{< katex >}}=11.40{{< /katex >}}%   (for weights)

{{< katex >}}C.V_{1}=5.48{{< /katex >}}% and {{< katex >}}C.V_{2}=11.40{{< /katex >}}%

Height is more consistent.
