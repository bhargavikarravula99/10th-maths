# introduction

>Coordinate geometry, also called Analytical geometry is a branch of > mathematics, in which curves in a plane are represented by algebraic > equations. For example, the equation *x* <sup>2</sup> + > *y*<sup>2</sup> = 1 , describes a circle of unit radius in the plane. > Thus coordinate geometry can be seen as a branch of mathematics which > interlinks algebra and geometry, where algebraic equations are > represented by geometric curves. This connection makes it possible to > reformulate problems in geometry to problems in algebra and vice > versa. Thus, in coordinate geometry, the algebraic equations have > visual representations thereby making our understanding much deeper. > For instance, the first degree equation in two variables *ax* + *by* + > *c* = 0 represents a straight line in a plane. Overall, coordinate > geometry is a tool to understand concepts visually and created new > branches of mathematics in modern times.
