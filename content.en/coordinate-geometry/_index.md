# 5.1 Introduction

> Coordinate geometry, also called Analytical geometry is a branch of > mathematics, in which curves in a plane are represented by algebraic > equations. For example, the equation *x* <sup>2</sup> + > *y*<sup>2</sup> = 1 , describes a circle of unit radius in the plane. > Thus coordinate geometry can be seen as a branch of mathematics which > interlinks algebra and geometry, where algebraic equations are > represented by geometric curves. This connection makes it possible to > reformulate problems in geometry to problems in algebra and vice > versa. Thus, in coordinate geometry, the algebraic equations have > visual representations thereby making our understanding much deeper. > For instance, the first degree equation in two variables *ax* + *by* + > *c* = 0 represents a straight line in a plane. Overall, coordinate > geometry is a tool to understand concepts visually and created new > branches of mathematics in modern times.

> In the earlier classes, we initiated the study of coordinate geometry > where we studied about coordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of > points in a plane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. > All these concepts form the basics of coordinate geometry. Let us now > recall some of the basic formulae.

# 5.2 Area of a Triangle
>In your earlier classes, you have studied how 
to calculate the area of a triangle when its base and 
corresponding height (altitude) are given. You have used 
the formula
> Area of triangle= (1/2)× base × altitude sq.units.

![alt text](./media/image256.png)

> Fig. 5.6
>With any three non-collinear points A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), 
B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>) and C(*y*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>)on a plane, we can form a triangle ABC

>Using distance between two points formula, we can calculate AB = c , BC = a , 
CA = b . a, b, c represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle ABC.
>Using 2s a = +b c + , we can calculate the area of triangle ABC by using the Heron’s formula s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) But this procedure of finding length of sides of DABC
and then calculating its area will be a tedious procedure.

>There is an elegant way of finding area of a triangle 
using the coordinates of its vertices. We shall discuss 
such a method below.

![alt text](./media/image257.png)
>

>Let ABC be any triangle whose vertices are at A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), 
B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>) and C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>)

>Draw AP, BQ and CR perpendiculars from A, B
and C to the x-axis, respectively. 
>Clearly ABQP, APRC and BQRC are all trapeziums

>Now from Fig.5.7, it is clear that
>Area of ABC= Area of trapezium ABQP + Area of trapezium APRC − Area of trapezium BQRC.
You also know that, the area of trapeziumS

>The vertices A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>) and C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>) of DABC are said to be “taken in order” 
if A, B, C are taken in anticlockwise direction. If we do this, then area of DABC will 
never be negative

The vertices of DPQR are P(0,-4), Q(3,1) and R(-8,1)
-  Draw PQR on a graph paper

-  Check if PQR is equilateral.

-  Find the area of PQR .

-  Find the coordinates of M, the mid-point of QP. 

-  Find the coordinates of N, the mid-point of QR.

-  Find the area of MPN .

-   What is the ratio between the areas of MPN and PQR ?


## 5.2.1 Collinearity of three points

>If three distinct points A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>) and C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>)  are collinear, then we 
cannot form a triangle, because for such a 
triangle there will be no altitude (height). 
Therefore, three points A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>) and C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>) will be collinear if the area of 
∆ = ABC 0 . 

>Similarly, if the area of ABC is zero, then the three points lie on the same straight 
line. Thus, three distinct points A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>) and C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>)  will be collinear if and 
only if area of ∆ = ABC 0 .

# 5.3 Area of a Quadrilateral

>If ABCD is a quadrilateral, then considering the 
diagonal AC, we can split the quadrilateral ABCD into 
two triangles ABC and ACD.

>Using area of triangle formula given its vertices, we 
can calculate the areas of triangles ABC and ACD.

>Now, Area of the quadrilateral ABCD
= Area of triangle ABC + Area of triangle ACD
>We use this information to find area of a quadrilateral 
when its vertices are given.

>Let  be the A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>), C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>) and D(*x*<sub>4</sub>,*y*<sub>4</sub>)
vertices of a quadrilateral ABCD.

>Now, Area of quadrilateral ABCD
= Area of the DABD +Area of the DBCD (Fig 5.9)

![alt text](./media/image261.png)


>The following pictorial representation helps us to write the above formula very easily. 
Take the vertices A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>), C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>) and D(*x*<sub>4</sub>,*y*<sub>4</sub>) in counter-clockwise direction 
and write them column-wise as that of the area of a triangle

(–a, –a), where a ¹ 0 is 64 square units, then identify the type of the quadrilateral

<b>Example 5.1</b> Find the area of the triangle whose vertices are (-3,5), (5,6) and (5,-2)

<b>Solution</b> Plot the points in a rough diagram and take them in counter-clockwise order

<b>Example 5.2</b> Show that the points P(-1.5,3), Q(6,-2), R(-3,4) are collinear.

<b>Solution</b> The points are P(-1.5,3), Q(6,-2), R(-3,4)

![alt text](./media/image268.png)


Therefore, the given points are collinear.


<b>Example 5.3</b> If the area of the triangle formed by the vertices A(-1,2), B (k,-2) and 
C(7,4) (taken in order) is 22 sq. units, find the value of k.

<b>Solution</b> The vertices are A(-1,2), B(k,-2) and C(7,4)
Area of triangle ABC is 22 sq.units

<b>Example 5.4</b> If the points P(-1,-4), Q(b,c) and R(5,-1) are collinear and if 2b+c=4 , 
then find the values of b and c

<b>Solution</b> Since the three points P(-1,-4), Q(b,c) and R(5,-1) are collinear,

<b>Example 5.5</b> The floor of a hall is covered with identical tiles which are in the shapes of 
triangles. One such triangle has the vertices at (-3,2), (-1,-1) and (1,2). If the floor of 
the hall is completely covered by 110 tiles, find the area of the floor.

<b>Solution</b> Vertices of one triangular tile are at 
 (-3,2), (-1,-1) and (1,2)

<b>Example 5.6</b> Find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the points (8,6), (5,11), (-5,12) and (-4,3).

<b>Solution</b> Before determining the area of quadrilateral, plot the vertices in a graph.
Let the vertices be A(8,6), B(5,11), C(–5,12) and D(–4,3)

# 5.4 Inclination of a Line

>The inclination of a line or the angle of inclination of a line is the angle which a 
straight line makes with the positive direction of X axis measured in the counter-clockwise 
direction to the part of the line above the X axis. The inclination of the line is usually 
denoted by q .


## Note

- The inclination of *X* axis and every line parallel to *X* axis is 0°
  .

- The inclination of *Y* axis and every line parallel to *Y* axis is
  90°.
