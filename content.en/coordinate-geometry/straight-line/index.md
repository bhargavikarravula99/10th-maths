![alt text](../media/image312.png)

Any first degree equation in two variables x and y of the form ax + + by c = 0 …(1) where a, b, c are real numbers and at least one of a, b is non-zero is called “Straight line” in XY plane.

## Equation of coordinate axes

![alt text](../media/image313.png)

The X axis and Y axis together are called coordinate axes. The x coordinate of every point on OY (Y axis) is 0. Therefore equation of OY(Y axis) is x = 0 (fig 5.27)

![alt text](../media/image314.png)

The y coordinate of every point on OX (X axis) is 0. Therefore the equation of OX (X axis) is y = 0 (fig 5.28)

## Equation of a straight line parallel to X axis

Let AB be a straight line parallel to X axis, which is at a distance ‘b’. Then y coordinate of every point on ‘AB’ is ‘b’. (fig 5.29)

Therefore, the equation of AB is y = b

##  Equation of a Straight line parallel to the Y axis

![alt text](../media/image316.png)

Let CD be a straight line parallel to Y axis, which is at a distance ‘c’. Then x coordinate of every point on CD is ‘c’. The equation of CD is x = c. (fig 5.30)

<b>Example 5.17</b> Find the equation of a straight line passing 
through (5,7) and is (i) parallel to X axis (ii) parallel to Y axis.

<b>Solution</b>
 (i) The equation of any straight line parallel to X axis is y=b.Since it passes through (5,7), b = 7 .Therefore, the required equation of the line is y=7.
  (ii) The equation of any straight line parallel toY axis is x=c Since it passes through (5,7), c = 5 Therefore, the required equation of the line is x=5.

## Slope-Intercept Form

> Every straight line that is not vertical will cut the Y axis at a single point. The 
y coordinate of this point is called y intercept of the line.

>A line with slope m and y intercept c can be expressed through the equation y=mx+c

>We call this equation as the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line.

<b>Example 5.18</b>  Find the equation of a straight line whose
(i) Slope is 5 and y intercept is -9 (ii) Inclination is 45° and y intercept is 11

<b>Solution</b>

 (i) Given, Slope = 5, y intercept, c = −9

Therefore, equation of a straight line is y m = +x c

y =5x-9 ⇒ 5x-9-y= 0

(ii) Given, q = ° 45 , y intercept, c = 11

Slope m = tan q = ° tan 45 = 1

Therefore, equation of a straight line is of the form y m = +x c

Hence we get, y=x+11 ⇒ x-y+11=0

<b>Example 5.19</b>

Calculate the slope and y intercept of the straight line  8x-7y+6=0

<b>Solution</b>

Equation of the given straight line is 8x-7y+6=0

7y = 8x+6 (bringing it to the form y=mx+c)

<b>Example 5.20</b> The graph relates temperatures y (in Fahrenheit degree) to temperatures x (in Celsius degree) (a) Find the slope and y intercept (b) Write an equation of the line (c) What is the mean temperature of the earth in Fahrenheit degree if its mean temperature is 25° Celsius?

<b>Solution</b>
![alt text](../media/image318.png)

The line crosses the Y axis at (0, 32)

So the slope is 9/5 and y intercept is 32.

![alt text](../media/image319.png)

(b) Use the slope and y intercept to write an equation

the equations is y=(9x/5)+32

(c) In Celsius, the mean temperature of the earth is25°. To 
find the mean temperature in Fahrenheit, we find the 
value of y when x = 25

 Therefore, the mean temperature of the earth is 77° F


 ## Point-Slope form

 Here we will find the equation of a straight line 
passing through a given point A (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>) and having the 
slope m.

![alt text](../media/image320.png)

LetP(x,y) be any point other than A on the given 
line. Slope of the line joining A (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)and P(x,y) is given by

![alt text](../media/image321.png)

>Therefore, the equation of the required line is 
y-y<sub>1</sub>=m(x-x<sub>1</sub>) (Point slope form)

<b>Example 5.21</b>

<b>Example 5.22</b> Find the equation of a line passing through the point A(1,4) and 
perpendicular to the line joining points (2,5) and (4,7).

![alt text](../media/image323.png)

<b>Solution</b>

Let the given points be A(1,4), B(2,5) and C(4,7).

Let m be the slope of the required line.
Since the required line is perpendicular to BC,

m x 1 = -1

m = -1

The required line also pass through the point A(1,4).

y-4 = -1(x-1)

y-4 = -x + 1

We get, x+y-5=0

##  Two Point form

Let A(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and B(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)be two given distinct points. Slope of the straight line

<b>Example 5.23</b>

 Find the equation of a straight line passing through (5 -3) and (7,-4).

 <b>Solution</b> The equation of a straight line passing through the two points is (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)

 ![alt text](../media/image326.png)

<b>Solution</b> Let A(6,10), B(14,12) be the 
points denoting the terrace of the 
buildings

The equation of the rod is the 
equation of the straight line passing 
through A(6,10) and B(14,12)

 ## Intercept Form

 We will find the equation of a line whose 
intercepts are a and b on the coordinate axes 
respectively

 ![alt text](../media/image328.png)

Let PQ be a line meeting X axis at A and Y axis at B. Let OA=a, OB=b. Then the coordinates of A and B are (a,0) and (b,0) respectively. Therefore, the equation of the line joining A and B is

<b>Example 5.25</b> Find the equation of a line which passes through (5,7) and makes intercepts 
on the axes equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

 Let the x intercept be ‘a’ and y intercept be ‘–a’

 ![alt text](../media/image331.png)

 Therefore, 5-7= a ⇒ a = −2

<b>Example 5.27</b> A mobile phone is put to use when the battery power is 100%. The percent of battery power ‘y’ (in decimal) remaining after using the mobile phone for x hours is assumed as y= -0.25x+1

- (i) Find the number of hours elapsed if the battery power is 40%.
- (ii) How much time does it take so that the battery has no power?

![alt text](../media/image333.png)

<b>Solution</b>

(i) To find the time when the battery power is 40%,
we have to take y = 0.40

0.40=-0.25x+1 ⇒ 0.25x = 0.60

we get, x=0.60/0.25=2.4 hours

(ii) If the battery power is 0 then y = 0

Therefore, 0 = -0.25x+1 gives -0.25x = 1 hence x = 4 hours.

Thus, after 4 hours, the battery of the mobile phone will have no power

<b>Example 5.28</b> A line makes positive intercepts on coordinate axes whose sum is 7 and it 
passes through (-3,8). Find its equation.

<b>Solution</b>

If a and b are the intercepts then a+b=7 or b=7-a

<b>Example 5.29</b> A circular garden is bounded by East Avenue and Cross Road. Cross Road intersects North Street at D and East Avenue at E. AD is tangential to the circular garden at A(3, 10). Using the figure

![alt text](../media/image335.png)

(a) Find the equation of 
- (i) East Avenue.
- (ii) North Street 
- (iii) Cross Road

(b) Where does the Cross Road intersect?

- (i) North Street 
- (ii) East Avenue

<b>Solution</b>

(a) (i) East Avenue is the straight line joining C(0,2) and B(7,2). Thus the 
 equation of East Avenue is obtained by using two-point form which is

 ![alt text](../media/image336.png)

(ii) Since the point D lie vertically above C(0,2). The x coordinate of D is 0.
 Since any point on North Street has x coordinate value 0.
 The equation of North Street is x = 0

(iii) To find equation of Cross Road.
 Center of circular garden M is at (7, 7), A is (3, 10)
 We first find slope of MA, which we call m1

![alt text](../media/image337.png)

 (b) (i) If D is (0,k) then D is a point on the Cross Road

 Therefore, substituting x = 0 , y k = in the equation of Cross Road,

 we get, 0-3k+18=0

 Value of k = 6

 Therefore, D is (0, 6)

 ![alt text](../media/image338.png)

(ii) To find E, let E be (q,2)

Put y = 2 in the equation of the Cross Road,

we get, 4q−6 + 18= 0

4q= −12 gives q = –3

Therefore, The point E is (-3,2)

Thus the Cross Road meets the North Street at D(0, 6) and 
 East Avenue at E (-3,2).
