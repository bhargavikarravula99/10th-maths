# Area of triangle

>In your earlier classes, you have studied how to calculate the area of a triangle when its base and corresponding height (altitude) are given. You have used the formula
> Area of triangle= (1/2)× base × altitude sq.units.

> Fig. 5.6
>With any three non-collinear points A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), 
B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>) and C(*y*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>)on a plane, we can form a triangle ABC

>Using distance between two points formula, we can calculate AB = c , BC = a , CA = b . a, b, c represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle ABC. >Using 2s a = +b c + , we can calculate the area of triangle ABC by using the Heron’s formula s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) But this procedure of finding length of sides of DABC and then calculating its area will be a tedious procedure.

>There is an elegant way of finding area of a triangle using the coordinates of its vertices. We shall discuss such a method below.

>Let ABC be any triangle whose vertices are at A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), 
B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>) and C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>)

>Draw AP, BQ and CR perpendiculars from A, B
and C to the x-axis, respectively. 
>Clearly ABQP, APRC and BQRC are all trapeziums

>Now from Fig.5.7, it is clear that >Area of ABC= Area of trapezium ABQP + Area of trapezium APRC − Area of trapezium BQRC. You also know that, the area of trapeziumS

>The vertices A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>) and C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>) of DABC are said to be “taken in order” if A, B, C are taken in anticlockwise direction. If we do this, then area of DABC will never be negative
