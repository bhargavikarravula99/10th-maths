# Area of Quadrilatral


>If ABCD is a quadrilateral, then considering the diagonal AC, we can split the quadrilateral ABCD into two triangles ABC and ACD.

>Using area of triangle formula given its vertices, we can calculate the areas of triangles ABC and ACD.

>Now, Area of the quadrilateral ABCD = Area of triangle ABC + Area of triangle ACD >We use this information to find area of a quadrilateral when its vertices are given.

>Let  be the A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>), C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>) and D(*x*<sub>4</sub>,*y*<sub>4</sub>)
vertices of a quadrilateral ABCD.

>Now, Area of quadrilateral ABCD
= Area of the DABD +Area of the DBCD (Fig 5.9)

>The following pictorial representation helps us to write the above formula very easily. Take the vertices A (*x*<sub>1</sub>,*y*<sub>1</sub>), B(*x*<sub>2</sub>,*y*<sub>2</sub>), C(*x*<sub>3</sub>,*y*<sub>3</sub>) and D(*x*<sub>4</sub>,*y*<sub>4</sub>) in counter-clockwise direction and write them column-wise as that of the area of a triangle

>If the area of a quadrilateral formed by the points (a, a), (–a, a), (a, –a) and (–a, –a), where a ¹ 0 is 64 square units, then identify the type of the quadrilateral

>Find all possible values of a.

<b>Example 5.1</b> Find the area of the triangle whose vertices are (-3,5), (5,6) and (5,-2)

<b>Solution</b> Plot the points in a rough diagram and take them in counter-clockwise order

>Let the vertices be A(-3,5), B(5,-2), C(5,6)

<b>Example 5.2</b> Show that the points P(-1.5,3), Q(6,-2), R(-3,4) are collinear.

<b>Solution</b> The points are P(-1.5,3), Q(6,-2), R(-3,4)

![alt text](../media/image268.png)


Therefore, the given points are collinear.


<b>Example 5.3</b> If the area of the triangle formed by the vertices A(-1,2), B (k,-2) and C(7,4) (taken in order) is 22 sq. units, find the value of k.

<b>Solution</b> The vertices are A(-1,2), B(k,-2) and C(7,4)
Area of triangle ABC is 22 sq.units

<b>Example 5.4</b> If the points P(-1,-4), Q(b,c) and R(5,-1) are collinear and if 2b+c=4 , 
then find the values of b and c

<b>Solution</b> Since the three points P(-1,-4), Q(b,c) and R(5,-1) are collinear,

<b>Example 5.5</b> The floor of a hall is covered with identical tiles which are in the shapes of triangles. One such triangle has the vertices at (-3,2), (-1,-1) and (1,2). If the floor of the hall is completely covered by 110 tiles, find the area of the floor.

<b>Solution</b> Vertices of one triangular tile are at 
 (-3,2), (-1,-1) and (1,2)

<b>Example 5.6</b> Find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the points (8,6), (5,11), (-5,12) and (-4,3).

<b>Solution</b> Before determining the area of quadrilateral, plot the vertices in a graph. Let the vertices be A(8,6), B(5,11), C(–5,12) and D(–4,3) Therefore, area of the quadrilateral ABCD
