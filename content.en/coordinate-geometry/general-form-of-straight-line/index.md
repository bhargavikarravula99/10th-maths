#  General Form of a Straight Line

The linear equation (first degree polynomial in two variables x and y) ax +by+ c = 0 (where a, b and c are real numbers such that at least one of a, b is non-zero) always represents a straight line. This is the general form of a straight line.

Now, let us find out the equations of a straight line in the following cases

- (i) parallel to ax + by + c = 0
- (ii) perpendicular to ax + by + c = 0

## Equation of a line parallel to the line ax + by + c = 0

The equation of all lines parallel to the line ax +by+ c = 0 can be put in the form 
ax +by+k = 0 for different values of k.

## Equation of a line perpendicular to the line ax +by+ c = 0

The equation of all lines perpendicular to the line ax +by+ c = 0 can be written as 
bx −ay+k = 0 for different values of k.

##  Slope of a straight line

The general form of the equation of a straight line is ax +by+c = 0 . (at least one of a, b is non-zero)

coefficient of x a = , coefficient of y b = , constant term= c .

The above equation can be rewritten as by = −ax −c

<b>Example 5.34</b>
 Find the equation of a straight line which is parallel to the line 3x-7y= 12 and passing through the point (6,4).

<b>Solution</b>
 Equation of the straight line, parallel to 3x-7y-12=0 is 3x-7y+k=0

 Since it passes through the point (6,4)

 3(6)− +7(4)+k = 0

 k = 28−18 = 10

 Therefore, equation of the required straight line is 3x-7y=10=0

 <b>Example 5.36</b>
  Find the equation of a straight line parallel to Y axis and passing through the point of intersection of the lines
  4x+5y=13 and x-8y+9=0

  <b>Solution</b>
   Given lines 
   - (1) 4x+5y=13 
   - (2) x-8y+9=0

<b>Example 5.37</b> The line joining the points A(0,5) and B(4,1) is a tangent to a circle whose centre C is at the point (4,4) find

- (i) the equation of the line AB.
- (ii) the equation of the line through C which is perpendicular to the line AB.
- (iii) the coordinates of the point of contact of tangent line AB with the circle

<b>Solution</b>

 (i) Equation of line AB, A(0,5) and B(4,1)

(ii) The equation of a line which is perpendicular 
to the line AB: x+y-5=0 is x-y+k=0

Since it is passing through the point (4,4), we have

4 – 4 + k = 0 ⇒ k = 0

he equation of a line which is perpendicular to AB and through C is x-y = 0

(iii) The coordinate of the point of contact P of the 
 tangent line AB with the circle is point of 
intersection of lines.

x+y-5=0 and x-y=0
