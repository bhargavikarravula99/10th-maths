#  Inclination of line


>The inclination of a line or the angle of inclination of a line is the angle which a straight line makes with the positive direction of X axis measured in the counter-clockwise direction to the part of the line above the X axis. The inclination of the line is usually denoted by q .


## Note

- The inclination of *X* axis and every line parallel to *X* axis is 0°
  .

- The inclination of *Y* axis and every line parallel to *Y* axis is
  90°.

> All these examples illustrate one important aspect called “Steepness”.
> The measure of steepness is called slope or gradient.

<h3>Activity 3</h3>



>The diagram contain four lines I<sub>1</sub>,I<sub>2</sub>,I<sub>3</sub> and I<sub>4</sub>

- (i) Which lines have positive slope?

- (ii) Which lines have negative slope?

#  Slopes of parallel lines

>Two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if 
their slopes are equal.


>Let I<sub>1</sub>,I<sub>2</sub> two non-vertical lines with slopes 
m1 and m2 respectively

>Let the inclination of the lines with positive direction 
of X axis be q1 and q2 respectively.

![alt text](../media/image292.png)

>Assume,I<sub>1</sub>,I<sub>2</sub> are parallel

> q<sub>1</sub>=q<sub>2</sub>

>tanq<sub>1</sub>=tanq<sub>2</sub>

>m<sub>1</sub>=m<sub>2</sub>

Hence, the slopes are equal.
Therefore, non-vertical parallel lines have equal slopes.

<b>Conversely</b>

![alt text](../media/image293.png)

>That is the corresponding angles are equal.

>Therfore I<sub>1</sub>,I<sub>2</sub> are parallel.

>Thus, non-vertical lines having equal slopes are parallel. 
Hence, non vertical lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.

#  Slopes of perpendicular lines

>Two non-vertical lines with slopes m<sub>1</sub>
and m<sub>2</sub> are perpendicular if and only if 
 m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>= −1 .

>Let I<sub>1</sub>,I<sub>2</sub> be two non-vertical lines 
with slopes  m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub> , respectively. Let their 
inclinations be q1 and q2 respectively

>Then m<sub>1</sub>= tanq<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>=tanq<sub>2</sub>

>First we assume that, I<sub>1</sub>,I<sub>2</sub> perpendicular to each other.

>Then ∠ABC= 90°−q (sum of angles of ABC is 180°)

<b>Conversely,</b>

>Letbe I<sub>1</sub>,I<sub>2</sub> two non-vertical lines with slopes m1 and m2 respectively, such that m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>= −1

>Let I<sub>1</sub>,I<sub>2</sub> be two lines with well-defined slopes m1 and m2 respectively, then

- (i) I<sub>1</sub>,I<sub>2</sub> if and only if m<sub>1</sub>=m<sub>2</sub> .

- (ii) I<sub>1</sub> is perpendicular to I<sub>2</sub> if and only if m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>= −1 .

<b>Example 5.12</b>  Show that the points (-2,5), (6,-1) and (2,2) are collinear

<b>Solution</b> he vertices are A(-2,5), B(6,-1) and C(2,2).

![alt text](../media/image301.png)

>We get, Slope of AB = Slope of BC

>Therefore, the points A, B, C all lie in a same straight line
Hence the points A, B and C are collinear.

<b>Example 5.13</b>  Let A(1,-2), B(6,-2), C(5,1) and D(2,1) be four points

- (i) Find the slope of the line segments (a) AB (b) CD
- (ii) Find the slope of the line segments (a) BC (b) AD
- (iii) What can you deduce from your answer.

<b>Solution</b>

![alt text](../media/image303.png)
![alt text](../media/image304.png)

(iii) The slope of AB and CD are equal so AB, CD are parallel.
 Similarly the lines AD and BC are not parallel, since their slopes are not equal.
 So, we can deduce that the quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezium

<b>Example 5.14</b> Consider the graph representing growth of population (in crores). Find 
the slope of the line AB and hence estimate the population in the year 2030?

<b>Solution</b> The points A(2005,96) and B(2015,100)are on the line AB.
